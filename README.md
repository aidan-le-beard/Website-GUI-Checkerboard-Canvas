### Note: Only code in index.html marked "Your code here" was written by me. The supplementary JavaScript files and remainder of index.html were provided by the professor. This assignment involved being able to read code provided by another person, create a GUI around it using provided assets, and implement button functions.

The code I have written includes loading the checker piece images, creation of a canvas element, drawing of a checkerboard of varying sizes with white always on the bottom right and checkerpieces on black squares, placing checker pieces correctly, and implementation of buttons below the checkerboard including resetting the board, moving pieces randomly and drawing a yellow line from the starting to square to the ending square, randomly king-ing a checker piece, and clearing the board.
